# lower_teeth_segmentation_with_roboflow
This repository focuses on tooth numbering for lower teeth images. With this notebook, you can use Roboflow's trained model (Which you can train through roboflow's AutoML solution on your dataset) and predict the model's output. It also allows you to generate instance masks for each tooth along with their corresponding tooth numbers.
